This assignment is related to the Sorting and searching concept. Two assignments are there one is for linear searching and the other one is using merge sort.
1. 1st assignment is based on array creation from the user, then based on target form a while loop for the no of transactions that the user wants.
    i.Inner loop for checking whether the sum of array elements is greater than the target value, if yes then print the no of transactions taken to reach the target 
      value.

2. 2nd assignment is based on performing merge sort in descending order and then checking how many no of that particular array element is used to achieve that money 
   value.
   eg: arr[]={89,10,5,2,4}
       sorting: {89,10,5,4,2}
       sum amount=900
       900/89=10 as quotient
       then 89*10=890
        900-890=10->remaining amount
        hence =10/10=1
        output: 89: 10
                10:1       required for 900 value
